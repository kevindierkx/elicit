## Elicit API Toolkit

The Elicit component is an API toolkit for PHP.

### Usage

Elicit has authentication supports for ```no authencation``` and ```basic-auth``` by default, adding support for other authentication drivers can be accomplished by adding new ```Connector``` instances.
By defining a ```driver``` you can manage the request handling for your connection. Elicit has support for ```Fractal``` based APIs by default. Request handling is defined in the ```Connection``` instances.
